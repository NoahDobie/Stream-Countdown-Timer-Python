# Stream-Countdown-Timer-Python
One day, I was in the middle of a stream and thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have a countdown timer on the screen?"
Checked out a couple of options, but they were like those big, clunky programs with a gazillion features I'd never touch!
Decided to whip up my own super simple countdown timer for the stream â€“ just what I needed!ðŸš€

**Features:**
Set precise countdowns in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
Automatically saves countdown updates to a specified text file location.
Seamless integration with Streamlabs: create a Text source for easy display.

**Customization:**
Easily modify the Python code to your liking and convert it to an executable (.exe) for convenience.

**Functionality:**
Pause, resume, and reset the countdown timer during your live stream.
Saves to a file that can be read from streaming software and updates automatically!

**Usage:**
Download and customize the Python script.
Save to a specified location.
Integrate into Streamlabs using a Text source for display.
