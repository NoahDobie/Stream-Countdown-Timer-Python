# Stream-Countdown-Timer-Python
One day, I was in the middle of a stream and thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have a countdown timer on the screen?"
Checked out a couple of options, but they were like those big, clunky programs with a gazillion features I'd never touch!
Decided to whip up my own super simple countdown timer for the stream â€“ just what I needed!ðŸš€

**Features:**
Set precise countdowns in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
Automatically saves countdown updates to a specified text file location.
Seamless integration with Streamlabs: create a Text source for easy display.

**Customization:**
Easily modify the Python code to your liking and convert it to an executable (.exe) for convenience.
It uses Tkinter for the GUI so super simple and basic to make changes!

**Functionality:**
Pause, resume, and reset the countdown timer during your live stream.
Saves to a file that can be read from streaming software and updates automatically!

**Usage:**
Download and customize the Python script.
Save to a specified location.
Integrate into Streamlabs using a Text source for display.

There might be some random bugs, but generally, it works great! Just be relatively slow with button presses!
